# mwra-data
Machine-readable version of the MWRA data at https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm

Please try to use [the csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nibrivia/mwra-data/master/mwra-data.csv) directly and don't web scrape the MWRA website on your own. I will do my best to keep this repo updated.

The columns are mostly self-explanatory and taken straight from the MWRA pdf. However, the confidence intervals are given in absolute value instead of relative. For example a measurement of 100 -10/+20 is given as 100, 90, 120 and not 100, 10, 20 (which is how it is in the pdf).
